class PBI(Scalarizer):
    r"""
    :class:`~torchjd.scalarization.Scalarizer` that combines the input tensor of values using the
    Penalty-based Boundary Intersection (PBI) scalarization, proposed in `MOEA/D: A Multiobjective
    Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4358754>`_.

    It decomposes the values, relative to a reference point, into a component along a preference
    direction and a component perpendicular to it, and penalizes the latter:

    .. math::
        d_1 = (L - z^*)^\top \hat r, \qquad
        d_2 = \lVert (L - z^*) - d_1 \hat r \rVert, \qquad
        d_1 + \theta\, d_2,

    where:

    - :math:`L_i` is the :math:`i`-th input value (the :math:`i`-th objective);
    - :math:`z^*` is the reference (ideal) point (the ``reference`` parameter);
    - :math:`\hat r = r / \lVert r \rVert` is the normalized preference direction (the ``weights``
      parameter);
    - :math:`d_1` is the distance along the preference direction and :math:`d_2` is the distance to
      it;
    - :math:`\theta` is the penalty coefficient applied to :math:`d_2` (the ``theta`` parameter).

    :param theta: The penalty coefficient :math:`\theta` applied to the perpendicular distance. Must
        be non-negative. A value of ``0`` reduces PBI to the projection onto the preference
        direction. The paper uses ``5`` in its experiments; there is no single best value, and the
        paper notes that a too large or too small value worsens the result.
    :param weights: The preference vector :math:`r`, giving the direction along which the values are
        decomposed. It must have the same shape as the values passed at call time. To approximate the
        whole Pareto front rather than a single trade-off, it should be re-sampled from a Dirichlet
        distribution and reassigned before every call, e.g. for ``m`` objectives
        ``pbi.weights = torch.distributions.Dirichlet(torch.ones(m)).sample()``.
    :param reference: The reference (ideal) point :math:`z^*` subtracted from the values. It should
        be a lower bound on the values. If ``None``, the origin is used, which assumes non-negative
        values. If provided, it must have the same shape as the values passed at call time.

    .. note::
        :math:`d_2` is a Euclidean norm, whose gradient is undefined when the values lie exactly on
        the preference direction (:math:`d_2 = 0`). To keep the gradient finite there, a small
        constant is added under the square root; this shifts the result by at most around
        :math:`10^{-6}` at that point and is negligible elsewhere.
