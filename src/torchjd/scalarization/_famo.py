class FAMO(Scalarizer, Stateful):
    r"""
    :class:`~torchjd.Stateful`
    :class:`~torchjd.scalarization.Scalarizer` that combines the input tensor of values using Fast
    Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO), proposed in `FAMO: Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization
    <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/b2fe1ee8d936ac08dd26f2ff58986c8f-Paper-Conference.pdf>`_.

    FAMO decreases all task losses at an approximately equal rate while using only the loss values,
    so it never needs the per-task gradients. The values are combined as

    .. math::
        c \sum_i z_i \log(\ell_i - b_i + \epsilon), \qquad
        z = \mathrm{softmax}(w), \qquad
        c = \left( \sum_i \frac{z_i}{\ell_i - b_i + \epsilon} \right)^{-1}

    where:

    - :math:`\ell_i` is the :math:`i`-th value (typically the loss of task :math:`i`);
    - :math:`b_i` is the lower bound on the :math:`i`-th loss (the ``min_losses`` parameter,
      ``0`` by default);
    - :math:`w_i` is the task-weighting logit of task :math:`i`, learned internally by FAMO;
    - :math:`z = \mathrm{softmax}(w)` are the task weights;
    - :math:`c` is a normalization constant (treated as a constant in the backward pass) that makes
      the resulting update a convex combination of the task gradients;
    - :math:`\epsilon` is a small positive constant for numerical stability.

    Backpropagating this scalarized loss gives FAMO's balanced update direction for the model.

    The task-weighting logits :math:`w` are not learned through that backward pass. Instead, after
    the model has been updated, call :meth:`update` with the losses recomputed on the same batch. It
    measures how much each loss changed across the step,

    .. math::
        \delta_i = \log(\ell_i^{\text{before}} - b_i + \epsilon)
        - \log(\ell_i^{\text{after}} - b_i + \epsilon),

    and takes an ``Adam`` step on :math:`w` in that direction. FAMO owns this ``Adam`` internally
    (configured by ``lr`` and ``weight_decay``), so you only call the scalarizer and then
    :meth:`update`; there is no second optimizer to manage.

    :param shape: The shape of the values to scalarize, used to create one task-weighting logit per
        value. An ``int`` ``n`` is interpreted as the shape ``(n,)``.
    :param min_losses: The per-task lower bound :math:`b` subtracted from the values before the
        logarithm. If provided, it must have the shape given by ``shape``. If ``None``, zeros are
        used, in which case the values must be strictly positive.
    :param lr: Learning rate of the internal ``Adam`` that learns the task-weighting logits. Must be
        non-negative. The paper uses ``0.025``.
    :param weight_decay: Weight decay of the internal ``Adam``, i.e. the paper's regularization
        coefficient on the logits. Must be non-negative. Defaults to ``1e-3`` (as in the paper's
        Algorithm 2 and in LibMTL); the official implementation uses ``1e-5``.

    The following example shows how to train a model with FAMO. The losses are recomputed on the
    same batch after the model step so that :meth:`update` can adjust the weights.

        >>> import torch
        >>> from torch.nn import Linear
        >>>
        >>> from torchjd.scalarization import FAMO
        >>>
        >>> model = Linear(3, 2)
        >>> scalarizer = FAMO(2)  # Move to the right device with e.g. FAMO(2).to(device="cuda")
        >>> optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
        >>>
        >>> features = torch.randn(8, 3)
        >>> losses = model(features).pow(2).mean(dim=0)  # One loss per output dimension.
        >>> loss = scalarizer(losses)
        >>> optimizer.zero_grad()
        >>> loss.backward()
        >>> optimizer.step()
        >>>
        >>> # Recompute the losses on the same batch, after the model update.
        >>> new_losses = model(features).pow(2).mean(dim=0)
        >>> scalarizer.update(new_losses)  # Updates the task weights internally.

    .. note::
        FAMO takes the logarithm of :math:`\ell_i - b_i`, so each value must stay strictly above its
        lower bound :math:`b_i` (the paper assumes non-negative losses). With the default
        ``min_losses`` of zeros, this means the values must be strictly positive. This precondition
        is not enforced.

        This implementation was adapted from the `official implementation
        <https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/FAMO>`_.
