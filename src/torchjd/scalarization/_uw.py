class UW(Scalarizer, Stateful):
    r"""
    :class:`~torchjd._mixins.Stateful` 
    :class:`~torchjd.scalarization.Scalarizer` that combines the input tensor of values using
    learned per-task uncertainties. ``UW`` is short for Uncertainty Weighting, the method proposed
    in `Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics
    <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Kendall_Multi-Task_Learning_Using_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf>`_.

    Each value :math:`L_i` is assigned a learnable log-variance :math:`s_i`, and the values are
    combined as

    .. math::
        \sum_i \left( \frac{1}{2} e^{-s_i} L_i + \frac{1}{2} s_i \right)

    where:

    - :math:`L_i` is the :math:`i`-th value (typically the loss of task :math:`i`);
    - :math:`s_i = \log \sigma_i^2` is the learnable log-variance of task :math:`i`.

    Following the paper, the log-variance :math:`s_i` is learned rather than the variance
    :math:`\sigma_i^2` directly: this is numerically more stable (the combination never divides by
    zero) and keeps :math:`s_i` unconstrained, since :math:`e^{-s_i}` is always positive. The
    :math:`s_i` are stored as an ``nn.Parameter``, so the parameters of this scalarizer must be
    passed to the optimizer to be learned jointly with the model.

    :param shape: The shape of the values to scalarize, used to create one log-variance per value.
        An ``int`` ``n`` is interpreted as the shape ``(n,)``.

    The following example shows how to co-train a model together with the per-task log-variances, by
    passing both sets of parameters to the optimizer.

        >>> import torch
        >>> from torch.nn import Linear
        >>>
        >>> from torchjd.scalarization import UW
        >>>
        >>> model = Linear(3, 2)
        >>> scalarizer = UW(2)
        >>> optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([*model.parameters(), *scalarizer.parameters()], lr=0.1)
        >>>
        >>> features = torch.randn(8, 3)
        >>> losses = model(features).pow(2).mean(dim=0)  # One loss per output dimension.
        >>> loss = scalarizer(losses)
        >>> loss.backward()
        >>> optimizer.step()

    .. note::
        The log-variances are initialized to ``0`` (i.e. :math:`\sigma_i^2 = 1`), which gives
        uniform weights at the start of training. The paper reports that the result is robust to
        this initialization. (`LibMTL <https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL>`_
        initializes them to ``-0.5`` instead.)
